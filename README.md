# magman
magman scraps torrent sites such as ThePirateBay, Torrentz2 and hosts a RSS feed for torrent clients etc.

`start.sh` needs to run periodically so systemd service files are provided. `server.sh` needs to run so the rss feed can be served through a local IP address. Also the paths in the files are given as an example. Change them to the paths relevant to YOUR setup as in where the magman files reside in your system.  

Requires scrapy.
